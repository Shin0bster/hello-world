# hello-world
I made this repository to get more familliar with Github, as I intend to use this site to make open source software and communicate with other white/gray hat hackers
I am 14 years old and in 8th grade, but don't let that fool you. I am very knowledgable about computers (a little iffy about networking, but getting there), and know Javascript ( a long time ago, still remember and can read most of it), Python, and C. I am running Ubuntu Linux (Kali in a few months, when I feel like I mastered Unix), and know my way around a chord progression.
